"""

## Displaying the Markdown content
from IPython.display import Markdown
Markdown(markdown_content)

## Exercise 7
# Arithmetic Expressions Examples



| Example          | Description                               |
| --------------   | ----------------------------------------- |
| `2 + 3`          | Addition                                  |
| `5 - 2`          | Subtraction                               |
| `4 * 6`          | Multiplication                            |
| `8 / 2`          | Division                                  |
| `10 // 3`        | Floor Division                            |
| `7 % 4`          | Modulus (Remainder)                       |
| `2 ** 4`         | Exponentiation                            |

# add
addition = 2 + 3
print("Addition:", addition)

# Subtraction
subtraction = 5 - 2
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)



## Exercise 8
# Multiply and Add Numbers
num1 = 4
num2 = 6

# Multiply
multiply = num1 * num2
print("Multiplication Result:", multiply)

# Add
addition = num1 + num2
print("Addition Result:", addition)



## Exercise 9
# Convert Minutes to Hours
minutes = 120

# Conversion
hours = minutes / 60

# Display Result
print(f"{minutes} minutes is {hours} hours.")
